Cartographing Kittens LFG — autonomous pipeline. Run all steps in order. Default to inline
execution and only use delegation where the runtime supports it cleanly.

## Memory Contract

Every phase must use the shared memory protocol from
`kitty/references/memory-workflow.md`:
- Planning calls `query_litter_box` and `query_treat_box`, then writes `Memory Context`
  into the plan.
- Work applies relevant memory and records validated implementation lessons with
  `add_litter_box_entry` and `add_treat_box_entry`.
- Review calls `query_litter_box` and `query_treat_box`, applies relevant memory, and
  records validated review lessons with `add_litter_box_entry` and `add_treat_box_entry`.
- Final output includes memory queried/applied/recorded counts.

## Sequential Phase

1. `/kitty:plan $ARGUMENTS` — Record the plan file path for steps 3 and 5.
2. `/kitty:work` — Execute the plan using the inline-first workflow contract.

## Parallel Phase

After work completes, run steps 3 and 4 in the best supported way for the active runtime.
Parallel execution is optional, not required:

3. `/kitty:review mode:report-only plan:<plan-path-from-step-1>` — Review in report-only mode
4. Run full test suite: `uv run pytest` (or project's test command)

Wait for both to complete.

## Autofix Phase

5. `/kitty:review mode:autofix plan:<plan-path-from-step-1>` — Apply safe fixes from review findings

## Finalize

6. Commit, push, and create PR only when explicitly requested or when the surrounding workflow requires it
7. Output `<promise>DONE</promise>` when the requested autonomous workflow is complete

## Contract

- Must remain meaningful without swarm primitives.
- Must not assume background agents, automatic PR creation, or persistent task teams.
- Must not skip litter/treat memory preflight or postflight in plan, work, or review phases.
