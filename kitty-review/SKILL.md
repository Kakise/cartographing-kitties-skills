# Cartographing Kittens: Review

Structured code review with **Cartographing Kittens-powered structural analysis** beyond the diff.
The review contract is inline-first; reviewer delegation is optional when runtime support is clear.

## Mode Detection

| Mode | Token | Behavior |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Interactive** | (default) | Review, present findings, ask about fixes |
| **Autofix** | `mode:autofix` | Apply safe fixes automatically, no user interaction |
| **Report-only** | `mode:report-only` | Read-only analysis, no edits |

## Argument Parsing

Optional tokens in `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `mode:autofix` or `mode:report-only` — select mode
- `base:<sha-or-ref>` — use as diff base
- `plan:<path>` — load plan for requirements verification

## Severity Scale

| Level | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **P0** | Critical breakage, vulnerability, data loss | Must fix |
| **P1** | High-impact defect in normal usage | Should fix |
| **P2** | Edge case, perf regression, maintainability | Fix if easy |
| **P3** | Minor improvement | Discretion |

## Workflow

### Stage 1: Determine Scope

Compute the diff:
```bash
# Detect base branch
BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || echo "HEAD~1")
git diff --name-only $BASE
git diff -U10 $BASE
```

If `base:` argument provided, use it directly.

### Stage 2: Intent Discovery

Understand what changes accomplish from:
- Branch name + commit messages
- PR title/body (if PR number provided)
- Plan document (if `plan:` provided)

Write 2-3 line intent summary. Pass to every reviewer.

### Stage 2b: Memory Preflight

Use the memory protocol in `kitty/references/memory-workflow.md` before reviewer passes:

1. Extract 2-4 terms from the intent summary, changed files, target symbols, and plan.
2. Call `query_litter_box(limit=20)` and `query_treat_box(limit=20)` with no filters.
3. For the strongest 1-2 terms, call filtered `query_litter_box(search=term, limit=10)`
   and `query_treat_box(search=term, limit=10)`.
4. Include relevant entries in a `### Memory Context` section. Reviewers must use:
   - Litter entries as known failure modes and anti-patterns to check first.
   - Treat entries as validated conventions and best-practice baselines.

### Stage 3: Build Subgraph Context

Pre-compute structural graph context via MCP tools. Subagents cannot call MCP tools,
so the orchestrator gathers all graph data here and passes it as structured text.

#### 3a. Check Annotation Coverage

Call `annotation_status()`. Record coverage counts (annotated vs total nodes).
If more than 50% of nodes are unannotated, emit a warning:
> "WARNING: >50% of codebase nodes are unannotated. Review quality may be reduced — summaries, roles, and tags will be missing for many symbols. Consider running `kitty:annotate` first."

#### 3b. File Structure for Modified Files

For each file in the diff file list, call `get_file_structure(path)`.

Collect all nodes from each file. Each node has: qualified_name, kind, line, summary, role, tags, annotation_status.

Cross-reference with the diff hunks to identify which specific symbols were modified
(a symbol is "modified" if any diff hunk overlaps its line range).

#### 3c. Query Neighbors for Modified Symbols

For each modified symbol identified in 3b, call `query_node(qualified_name)`.

Collect the neighbor lists (callers, callees, inherited classes, containers, dependents, dependencies). Each neighbor includes: qualified_name, kind, edge_kind, summary, role, tags.

#### 3d. Blast Radius for Public Symbols

For each modified symbol that is public (not prefixed with `_`), call
`find_dependents(qualified_name, max_depth=3)`.

Record transitive dependents at each depth level, including their summary, role, and tags.

#### 3e. Upstream Dependencies

For all modified symbols, call `find_dependencies(qualified_name)`.

Record what each symbol depends on, including summary, role, and tags.

#### 3f. Identify Edges Between Changed Nodes

From the neighbor data collected in 3c, identify all edges where BOTH source and target
are in the set of modified symbols. These are intra-change edges that reviewers need
to verify for contract consistency.

#### 3g. Format Subgraph Context Block

Assemble the collected data into a structured text block with these sections:

```
## Subgraph Context

### Annotation Status
- Total nodes: N
- Annotated: M (X%)
- WARNING (if applicable)

### Memory Context
- Litter lessons to check:
  - [category] description — context
- Treat lessons to enforce:
  - [category] description — context
- Memory gaps:
  - No relevant entries found for [term]

### Changed Nodes
| Qualified Name | Kind | Summary | Role | Tags | Location | Annotation Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| module.path::ClassName::method | method | "Does X" | "handler" | [api, auth] | src/foo.py:42 | annotated |
...

### Edges Between Changed Nodes
| Source | Target | Edge Kind |
|---|---|---|
| module::func_a | module::func_b | calls |
...

### Neighbors (1-hop)
For each changed node, list its callers and callees with summaries and roles:

#### module.path::ClassName::method
- CALLER: other_module::handler (role: "endpoint", summary: "Handles POST /users")
- CALLEE: db_module::save (role: "repository", summary: "Persists user record")
...

### Transitive Dependents (from find_dependents, max_depth=3)
| Qualified Name | Depth | Kind | Summary | Role | Tags |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| api.routes::create_user | 1 | function | "POST /users endpoint" | endpoint | [api] |
| tests.test_api::test_create_user | 2 | function | "Tests user creation" | test | [test] |
...

### Transitive Dependencies (from find_dependencies)
| Qualified Name | Kind | Summary | Role | Tags |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| db.models::User | class | "User ORM model" | model | [db, core] |
...
```

### Stage 3h: Structural Pre-checks (new tools)

#### 3h-i. Validate Graph Structure

Call `validate_graph(scope=changed_files)` to detect structural issues in the changed area:
- Circular dependencies introduced by the change
- Orphaned nodes (symbols with no edges)
- Missing edges that should exist

Include any issues found in the subgraph context block under a `### Structural Health` section.

#### 3h-ii. Rank Nodes by Importance

Call `rank_nodes(scope=changed_files)` to score each changed symbol by structural importance.
Include importance scores in the subgraph context — reviewers focus P0 attention on
high-importance nodes (a bug in a highly-connected symbol has wider blast radius).

Add an `Importance` column to the `### Changed Nodes` table in the subgraph context.

#### 3h-iii. Semantic Discovery

Call `search(query=feature_keywords)` using 2-3 keywords extracted from the intent summary.
Identify semantically related code that might be affected but is NOT in the dependency graph.
Include any discovered nodes in a `### Semantically Related (not in dependency graph)` section.

### Stage 4: Index & Apply Review Workflow

1. Call `index_codebase(full=false)` to ensure the graph reflects current changes
2. Apply the review workflow using the diff, file list, intent summary, the **subgraph context block** (from Stage 3, including importance scores, structural health, and semantic matches), and the plan (if provided).

Optional delegation path:

If the active runtime supports delegation cleanly, dispatch reviewer agents in parallel with the same inputs:

**Always-on (every review):**
- **`expert-kitten-correctness`** — Logic errors, edge cases, state bugs
- **`expert-kitten-testing`** — Test coverage gaps via dependency analysis

**Conditional:**
- **`expert-kitten-impact`** — When diff touches 3+ files or modifies public symbols
- **`expert-kitten-structure`** — When new files are created or modules are added

### Stage 5: Merge & Deduplicate

Collect findings from delegated reviewers or from inline review passes. Merge:
- Deduplicate by file + line (keep highest severity)
- If reviewers conflict, prefer the more conservative finding
- Sort by severity (P0 first), then by file

### Stage 6: Present or Apply

**Interactive mode:**
- Present findings grouped by severity.
- For each P0 finding, issue a per-finding `AskUserQuestion` (single-select,
  header `"P0 finding"`, recommended option first) per
  `kitty/references/ask-user-protocol.md`:

  ```yaml
  question: "[P0] <file:line> — <issue>. How should we handle it?"
  header: "P0 finding"
  multiSelect: false
  options:
    - label: "Fix now (Recommended)"
      description: "Apply the suggested fix and re-run tests."
    - label: "Defer (keep in report)"
      description: "Leave the finding in the review artifact; do not edit code."
    - label: "Dismiss"
      description: "Mark as not-a-bug; suppress in future reports."
  ```

- For P1/P2 findings, batch them into a single `multiSelect: true`
  `AskUserQuestion` with header `"Triage"`. Each option carries the severity
  prefix and a one-sentence summary. If there are more than four findings to
  triage, batch four at a time and loop.
- Apply fixes the user approves. P3 findings stay in the report unless the user
  explicitly opts in.

**Autofix mode (no user interaction):**
- Do NOT call `AskUserQuestion`.
- Apply all `safe_auto` fixes automatically.
- Write remaining findings to a review artifact.
- Re-run tests after fixes.
- If tests fail, revert the last fix if possible and continue conservatively.

**Report-only mode:**
- Do NOT call `AskUserQuestion`.
- Present findings summary.
- Do NOT edit any files.
- Return structured report.

### Stage 7: Requirements Verification (if plan provided)

If a plan was loaded:
- Check each requirement (R1, R2...) against the diff
- Flag requirements with no corresponding changes
- Note any changes not traced to a requirement

### Stage 8: Memory Postflight

Record durable lessons from the review:
- Call `add_litter_box_entry` when the review finds a real regression, repeated failure mode,
  unsupported path, or anti-pattern that future reviews should check.
- Call `add_treat_box_entry` when the review validates a reusable convention, pattern, or
  optimization that future work should follow.
- Use `source_agent="kitty:review"` for inline findings, or the reviewer agent name for
  delegated findings.
- Do not record speculative or low-confidence findings.

## Tips

- Cartographing Kittens reviewers find issues grep-based reviews miss: unupdated dependents, broken contracts, circular dependencies
- `expert-kitten-impact` catches the most critical issues — the "did you forget to update X?" findings
- Use `mode:autofix` in pipelines, `mode:report-only` for dry runs
- The subgraph context gives reviewers full structural awareness without needing MCP tool access

## Contract

- Must work without delegated reviewers.
- May use preserved framework reviewers when the runtime supports it.
- Must not rely on a plugin-backed agent registry to perform a valid review.
- Must query litter/treat memory before review and record validated durable lessons after review.
- Must issue every interactive triage prompt via `AskUserQuestion` per
  `kitty/references/ask-user-protocol.md`. `mode:autofix` and
  `mode:report-only` must not call `AskUserQuestion`.
