# Cartographing Kittens: Brainstorm

Explore **WHAT** to build through dialogue and Cartographing Kittens-powered codebase analysis.
Produces a requirements document that feeds into `kitty:plan`.

## Runtime Posture

This workflow is **inline-first**. The orchestrator gathers graph context and can complete the
brainstorm without delegating. If the active runtime supports delegation cleanly, the preserved
framework subagents may be used as an optimization, not as a requirement.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Index & Understand

1. Call `index_codebase(full=false)` to ensure the graph is fresh
2. If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the feature description
3. If no arguments, ask the user in plain text: "What problem are you trying to
   solve or what feature are you considering?" This is the documented free-form
   exception in `kitty/references/ask-user-protocol.md` (no enumerable options
   exist before research). Any follow-up refinement of the description must use
   `AskUserQuestion`.
4. Query memory for the topic using `query_litter_box(limit=20)` and `query_treat_box(limit=20)`,
   then filtered searches for the strongest 1-2 feature terms. Use relevant entries to frame
   constraints, prior failures, and validated patterns.

### Phase 2: Research Context

Build the subgraph context before any optional delegation:

1. **Annotation status** — Call `annotation_status()`. Record total nodes, annotated count, and coverage percentage.

2. **Search for relevant nodes** — Call `search` with 2-4 feature-area keywords extracted from the feature description. Collect matching qualified names, file paths, summaries, tags, and roles.

3. **File structures** — Call `get_file_structure` on the top 3-5 files identified by search results. Capture node listings with kinds, summaries, tags, and roles.

4. **Key symbol details** — Call `query_node` on the 3-5 most important symbols from search results (classes, entry points, core functions). Capture their metadata and neighbors.

5. **Dependency context** — Call `find_dependencies(name=target, max_depth=2)` for each key symbol. Understand what the feature area depends on (upstream constraints).

6. **Dependent context** — Call `find_dependents(name=target, max_depth=2)` for each key symbol. Understand who depends on the feature area (scope implications — changes here ripple outward).

**Format the context as structured text:**

```
## Subgraph Context

### Annotation Status
- Total nodes: N
- Annotated: N (X%)
- Pending: N

### Memory Context
- Litter lessons to avoid:
  - [category] description — context
- Treat lessons to preserve:
  - [category] description — context
- Memory gaps:
  - No relevant entries found for [term]

### Target Nodes (from search)
- `qualified::name` — kind: X, role: Y, tags: [a, b], summary: "..."
  File: path/to/file.py
- ...

### File Structures
#### path/to/file.py
- `module::Class` (class) — role: Y, summary: "..."
  - `module::Class::method` (method) — role: Y, summary: "..."
- ...

### Key Symbol Details
#### `qualified::name`
- Kind: X, Role: Y, Tags: [a, b]
- Summary: "..."
- Neighbors:
  - calls -> `other::symbol` (role: Z)
  - imports -> `another::module` (role: W)

### Edges Between Target Nodes
| Source | Target | Edge Kind |
|---|---|---|
| module::func_a | module::func_b | calls |

### Dependencies (what target area depends on)
#### `qualified::name`
- Depth 1: `dep::symbol` (kind, role)
- Depth 2: `dep::dep::symbol` (kind, role)

### Dependents (what depends on target area)
#### `qualified::name`
- Depth 1: `consumer::symbol` (kind, role)
- Depth 2: `consumer::consumer::symbol` (kind, role)
```

Optional delegation path:

If the runtime supports delegation cleanly, the orchestrator may dispatch these framework agents
in parallel, passing each the feature description and the formatted subgraph context:

- **`librarian-kitten-researcher`** — Pass: full subgraph context (annotation status, target nodes, file structures, symbol details, dependencies, dependents, edges). Scope: architecture, technology stack, module organization
- **`librarian-kitten-pattern`** — Pass: search results, file structures, and dependency/dependent context from the subgraph. Scope: existing patterns relevant to the feature area

Otherwise, the orchestrator synthesizes the same findings inline:
- technology stack
- relevant patterns
- key files
- existing conventions

### Phase 3: Adaptive Questioning

Use research findings to ask targeted questions. Each question must be issued via
`AskUserQuestion` with 2-4 options derived from the research (not invented).
Follow `kitty/references/ask-user-protocol.md` — recommended option first with
the `(Recommended)` suffix, header ≤ 12 chars, single-select unless choices are
truly non-exclusive.

Cover at most these four categories, one prompt at a time so the user's answer
to the previous question can shape the next:

1. **Problem clarity** — header: `"Problem"`. Options enumerate the alternative
   readings of the request that match research findings (e.g., "Fix the auth
   middleware bug", "Replace the auth middleware altogether").
2. **Scope boundaries** — header: `"Scope"`. Options enumerate the related
   areas surfaced by `librarian-kitten-pattern` / `find_dependents` (e.g.,
   "Just `src/auth/`", "Auth + session storage", "Auth + session + audit log").
3. **Success criteria** — header: `"Success"`. Options enumerate observable
   outcomes (e.g., "All callers migrate", "New callers use new API; old callers
   stay", "Strict cutover").
4. **Constraints** — header: `"Pattern"` / `"Constraint"`. Options enumerate the
   choice between following an existing pattern or proposing a new one.

Stop questioning when:
- Problem is clear
- Scope is bounded
- Success criteria are defined
- 3-5 prompts have fired (don't over-question)

If a follow-up cannot be enumerated as 2-4 options, fall back to a free-form
plain-text question per `ask-user-protocol.md`.

**Pipeline mode:** If invoked from `kitty:lfg` or another orchestrator, skip the
`AskUserQuestion` calls. Infer requirements from the feature description and
research findings, picking the recommended option silently for each category.

### Phase 4: Write Requirements

Create the requirements document at:
`docs/brainstorms/YYYY-MM-DD-NNN-<topic>-requirements.md`

Create `docs/brainstorms/` if it doesn't exist. Check existing files for today's date to determine sequence number.

Template:
```
# [Feature Title] — Requirements

## Problem Frame
[What problem this solves and for whom]

## Codebase Context
[Key findings from Cartographing Kittens research — relevant patterns, architecture, existing code]

## Requirements
- R1. [Specific, testable requirement]
- R2. [Specific, testable requirement]

## Success Criteria
- [Observable outcome that proves requirements are met]

## Scope Boundaries
- In scope: [explicit inclusions]
- Out of scope: [explicit exclusions]

## Key Decisions
- [Decision]: [Rationale]

## Open Questions
### Resolve Before Planning
- [Blocking question]

### Deferred
- [Non-blocking question]
```

### Phase 5: Handoff

**Pipeline mode:** Return the requirements file path and continue.

**Interactive mode:** Issue a single `AskUserQuestion` (single-select, header
`"Brainstorm"`) with the recommended option first. Follow
`kitty/references/ask-user-protocol.md`:

```yaml
question: "What would you like to do next with this requirements doc?"
header: "Brainstorm"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "Run kitty:plan (Recommended)"
    description: "Turn the requirements into an actionable implementation plan now."
  - label: "Open in editor"
    description: "Read or refine the requirements locally before planning."
  - label: "Keep refining requirements"
    description: "Stay in brainstorm and ask another round of clarifying questions."
```

## Contract

- Must work without subagents.
- May use preserved framework subagents when the runtime supports it.
- Must not assume a blocking-question tool or a plugin-backed agent registry.
- Must query litter/treat memory and include relevant lessons in Codebase Context.
- Must issue every interactive prompt via `AskUserQuestion` per
  `kitty/references/ask-user-protocol.md`, except for the single free-form
  feature-description question in Phase 1 step 3.
