# Cartographing Kittens: Explore

Explore codebase structure through the Cartographing Kittens graph — definitions, imports,
call relationships, and inheritance.

## When to use

- "What's in this file / module / package?"
- "How is this project organized?"
- "What does X define / export / contain?"
- "Show me the structure of Y"
- Browsing code organization before making changes

## Workflow

The orchestrator builds all context directly — no agent dispatch needed for exploration.
Agents CANNOT call MCP tools, so the orchestrator IS the explorer.

### Step 1: Ensure Index & Check Coverage

1. Call `index_codebase(full=false)` to ensure the graph is fresh
2. Call `annotation_status()` — check coverage percentage
   - If coverage <30%, warn: "Annotation coverage is low (X%). Semantic search and summaries will be limited. Consider running `kitty:annotate` first."

### Step 2: Gather Context (choose tools based on the question)

**Broad overview (file or module exploration):**
- Call `get_context_summary(file_paths=[...])` for a token-efficient overview of files/modules
- Call `rank_nodes(scope=target_files, limit=10)` to surface the most important symbols

**Multi-symbol deep dive:**
- Call `batch_query_nodes(names=[...], include_neighbors=true)` for detailed info on multiple symbols at once

**Relationship exploration:**
- Call `find_dependents(name=..., max_depth=2)` for "who uses this?"
- Call `find_dependencies(name=..., max_depth=2)` for "what does this depend on?"

**Semantic/concept search:**
- Call `search(query="keyword")` (best after annotation)

**Single symbol lookup:**
- Call `query_node(name="ClassName")` for a single symbol with neighbors

### Step 3: Present Results

Format the gathered context as structured output for the user. Include:
- File/module structure with definitions
- Importance rankings (from `rank_nodes`)
- Key relationships (dependencies, dependents)
- Annotation coverage warning if applicable

## Tools

| Tool | Use for |
|---|---|
| `index_codebase` | Ensure the graph is up to date |
| `annotation_status` | Check annotation coverage, warn if low |
| `get_context_summary` | Token-efficient overview of files/modules |
| `batch_query_nodes` | Look up multiple symbols at once with neighbors |
| `get_file_structure` | See all definitions in a single file |
| `query_node` | Look up a single symbol with neighbors |
| `find_dependents` | Who uses this symbol? (blast radius) |
| `find_dependencies` | What does this symbol depend on? |
| `rank_nodes` | Surface the most important symbols in a scope |
| `search` | Find nodes by name or summary (best after annotation) |

## Conventions

- **Qualified names** use `::` separator: `module.path::ClassName::method_name`
- **Node kinds**: `module`, `class`, `function`, `method`, `variable`
- **Edge kinds**: `imports`, `calls`, `inherits`, `contains`, `depends_on`

## Tips

- Use `get_context_summary` for broad exploration — it is more token-efficient than calling `get_file_structure` + `query_node` for each file
- Use `batch_query_nodes` instead of multiple `query_node` calls when exploring several symbols
- Use `rank_nodes` to identify the most structurally important symbols before diving deeper
- For semantic queries ("find auth code"), check `annotation_status` first — if many
  nodes are pending, run `kitty:annotate` before searching
- See `kitty/references/tool-reference/` for full parameter details
